# Variables and Basic Concepts in Python ðŸŽ¯

Python is a dynamically typed language, which means variable types are determined at runtime, unlike statically typed languages like Java where types must be declared explicitly.

## Basic Variable Types and Assignment

```python
age = 20          # Integer
price = 19.95     # Float (decimal number)
first_name = 'Mosh'  # String
is_online = False    # Boolean

# Variables can be reassigned
age = 30  # age is now 30
print(f"Current age: {age}")
```

## Dynamic Typing

Python allows variables to change their type during runtime.

```python
n = 0
print(f'n = {n}')  # n is an integer

n = "abc"
print(f'n = {n}')  # n is now a string
```

## Multiple Assignments

Python allows multiple variables to be assigned in a single line.

```python
n, m = 0, "abc"  # n is integer, m is string
print(f'n = {n}, m = {m}')
```

## Increment Operations

There are several ways to increment a number in Python:

```python
n = n + 1  # explicit increment
print(f'After increment: {n}')

n += 1     # shorthand increment
print(f'After shorthand increment: {n}')

# Note: n++ is not valid in Python
```

## F-strings (Formatted String Literals)

F-strings (introduced in Python 3.6) are a way to embed expressions inside string literals. They're called 'f-strings' because you need to prefix the string with 'f' or 'F'.

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 25
print(f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old")  # Basic usage

# You can put expressions inside the curly braces
x = 10
y = 20
print(f"The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}")  # Using expressions

# Formatting numbers
pi = 3.14159
print(f"Pi rounded to 2 decimal places: {pi:.2f}")  # Number formatting
```

## Null Values

In Python, we use `None` to represent null values:

```python
x = None  # represents a null value
```

## Best Practices

1. Use descriptive variable names
2. Follow Python naming conventions (snake_case for variables)
3. Initialize variables before use
4. Use type hints when possible (Python 3.6+)
5. Keep variable names meaningful and self-documenting

## Common Pitfalls

1. Remember that Python is case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different variables)
2. Variables must be initialized before use
3. Dynamic typing can lead to unexpected type changes
4. Be careful with mutable vs immutable types
