## ðŸ’¡ JavaScript vs Python

JavaScript is more similar to Python than Java because:
- Both are dynamically typed languages
- Both have flexible and readable syntax
- Both treat functions as first-class citizens

TypeScript, on the other hand, is more similar to Java because it adds static typing and class-based inheritance.

Happy Coding! ðŸŽ‰
